# NOTE:
# The following directives are only relevant when linting the whole
# project directory, ie. running `eslint .` ⚠️

# If you compile JavaScript into some output folder, exclude it here
dist
build
packages/**/types/*
packages/**/esm/*
packages/**/cjs/*
packages/**/umd/*

# Highly recommended to re-include JavaScript dotfiles to lint them
# (This will cause .eslintrc.js to be linted by ESLint 🤘)
!.*.js

# Some tools use this pattern for their configuration files. Lint them!
!*.config.js

# Ignore vendor directory in `packages/web-twig`
vendor

# Ignore the playwright-report directory
playwright-report
