# Card

Card is a compact container for organizing and displaying content about a single topic.

Card is a versatile composition of a few subcomponents:

- [Card](#card-1)
  - [CardArtwork](#cardartwork)
  - [CardMedia](#cardmedia)
  - [CardLogo](#cardlogo)
  - [CardBody](#cardbody)
    - [CardTitle](#cardtitle)
    - [CardEyebrow](#cardeyebrow)
  - [CardFooter](#cardfooter)

Additionally, Card can be used with [CardLink](#making-the-whole-card-clickable) to create a clickable card.

## Card

Card is the main container of the composition.

```jsx
<Card>
  {/* CardArtwork or CardMedia */}
  {/* CardBody */}
  {/* CardFooter */}
</Card>
```

Regardless of the [layout](#card-layout), the Card subcomponents must be arranged in the following order:

1. [CardArtwork](#cardartwork) (optional) or CardMedia (optional) ‚Äî first
2. [CardLogo](#cardlogo) (optional)
3. [CardBody](#cardbody)
4. [CardFooter](#cardfooter) (optional) ‚Äì last

‚ÑπÔ∏è Every `<div>` counts, especially on large pages. During the development of the Card component, we did our best to
balance between flexibility and simplicity. To provide the best performance, we decided to use the CSS grid layout with
predefined grid areas. This way, we can avoid unnecessary elements and keep the Card structure as flat as possible.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Vertical spacing between subcomponents is implemented using the `margin-bottom` property and the Card relies on
the specified order of its subcomponents. Since the Card uses the CSS grid layout with predefined grid areas, using the
`gap` property would lead to redundant spacing when dropping in just some of the subcomponents.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Arranging the subcomponents in a different order will break the spacing of the subcomponents and may also have
negative impact on accessibility of the Card.**

### Card Layout

Card can be displayed in a vertical, horizontal, or reversed horizontal layout.

```jsx
// Vertical card
<Card direction="vertical">
  {/* ‚Ä¶ */}
</Card>

// Horizontal card -->
<Card direction="horizontal">
  {/* ‚Ä¶ */}
</Card>

// Reversed horizontal card -->
<Card direction="horizontal-reversed">
  {/* ‚Ä¶ */}
</Card>
```

üëâ Keep in mind that, no matter the layout, the Card subcomponents must be arranged in the order
[specified above](#card-1).

### Responsive Card Layout

Pass an object to props to set different values for different breakpoints. The values will
be applied from mobile to desktop and if not set for a breakpoint, the value from the
previous breakpoint will be used.

```jsx
<Card direction={{ mobile: 'vertical', tablet: 'horizontal', desktop: 'horizontal-reversed' }}>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</Card>
```

### Boxed Cards

Card can be displayed with a border and a box shadow on hover.

```jsx
<Card isBoxed>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</Card>
```

On top of the API options, the components accept [additional attributes][readme-additional-attributes].
If you need more control over the styling of a component, you can use [style props][readme-style-props]
and [escape hatches][readme-escape-hatches].

## CardArtwork

CardArtwork is an optional subcomponent that displays a small image or icon.

```jsx
<CardArtwork>
  <svg width="24" height="24" aria-hidden="true">
    <use xlink:href="/assets/icons/svg/sprite.svg#file" />
  </svg>
</CardArtwork>
```

### Artwork Alignment (Horizontal Layouts Only)

In the vertical Card layout, the artwork can be horizontally aligned to the start, center, or end of the Card.
Available alignment options are derived from the [AlignmentX][dictionary-alignment] dictionary.
To align the artwork, use `alignmentX` prop:

- `left` (default)
- `center`
- `right`

```jsx
<CardArtwork alignmentX="center">
  <svg width="24" height="24" aria-hidden="true">
    <use xlink:href="/assets/icons/svg/sprite.svg#file" />
  </svg>
</CardArtwork>
```

### API

| Name         | Type                                          | Default | Required | Description                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `alignmentX` | [AlignmentX dictionary][dictionary-alignment] | `left`  | ‚úï        | Alignment of artwork content |

On top of the API options, the components accept [additional attributes][readme-additional-attributes].
If you need more control over the styling of a component, you can use [style props][readme-style-props]
and [escape hatches][readme-escape-hatches].

## CardMedia

To display larger images or videos, use the CardMedia subcomponent.

```jsx
<CardMedia>
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="" />
</CardMedia>
```

üëâ Please note the empty `alt` attribute which means the image is purely decorative and does not convey any information.

üëâ Please note that there is no link around or inside the CardMedia subcomponent. See the
[Linking the Media](#linking-the-media) section for more.

Or, for a video:

```jsx
<CardMedia>
  <video
    src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
    poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg"
    controls
    muted
    playsInline
  />
</CardMedia>
```

### Media Sizes

CardMedia can be displayed in different sizes. The available sizes are based on the [Size][dictionary-size] dictionary.
By default, the media uses the `auto` size option which means the media will be displayed in its original aspect ratio.
Other options set the media to a specific height (in the vertical Card layout) or width (in the horizontal Card layout).

In the vertical Card layout, the media is always expanded to the full width of the CardBody content. For boxed Cards,
the media can be even expanded [to the edges](#expanding-the-media) of the Card.

- `auto` (default)
- `small`
- `medium`
- `large`

For example:

```jsx
<CardMedia size="small">{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</CardMedia>
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è The Card automatically prevents the media from overflowing the Card container or even pushing the subsequent
CardBody content out of the Card. In such cases, the media will be cropped to fit the Card container.

### Expanding the Media

To expand the media to the full width or height of a boxed Card, use the `isExpanded` prop. This option is
available for both vertical and horizontal (including reversed horizontal) Card layouts.

```jsx
<Card>
  <CardMedia isExpanded>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</CardMedia>
  <CardBody>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</CardBody>
</Card>
```

Additionally, there is a `filledHeight` prop that expands the media to match the height of the CardBody
content. This option works with both boxed and non-boxed Card, but is only available in the horizontal Card layout.

```jsx
<Card direction="horizontal">
  <CardMedia hasFilledHeight>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</CardMedia>
  <CardBody>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</CardBody>
</Card>
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Both options work with all media sizes.

üéâ Fun fact: The `isExpanded` and `hasFilledHeight` props produce the same result for non-boxed
horizontal (and reversed horizontal) Cards. But in all other contexts, the two props behave differently.

On top of the API options, the components accept [additional attributes][readme-additional-attributes].
If you need more control over the styling of a component, you can use [style props][readme-style-props]
and [escape hatches][readme-escape-hatches].

## CardLogo

CardLogo is an optional subcomponent that displays a logo. To achieve the best visual result, use the PartnerLogo
subcomponent.

```jsx
<CardLogo>
  <PartnerLogo>
    <img src="‚Ä¶" alt="Product Name" />
  </PartnerLogo>
</CardLogo>
```

## CardBody

CardBody is the main content area of the Card.

```jsx
<CardBody>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</CardBody>
```

### API

| Name           | Type   | Default | Required | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `isSelectable` | `bool` | `false` | ‚úï        | Whether the text is selectable |

On top of the API options, the components accept [additional attributes][readme-additional-attributes].
If you need more control over the styling of a component, you can use [style props][readme-style-props]
and [escape hatches][readme-escape-hatches].

### CardTitle

CardTitle displays the main title of the Card. It uses the `<h4>` heading element by default, but you can use any other
heading level that fits your document outline.

```jsx
<CardTitle>
  <a href="#">Card Title</a>
</CardTitle>
```

The CardTitle is emphasized by default. To deemphasize it, simply set the `isHeading` prop to false:

```jsx
<CardTitle isHeading={false}>
  <a href="#">Card Title</a>
</CardTitle>
```

üëâ See below how to extend the link in CardTitle to [make the whole card clickable](#making-the-whole-card-clickable).

### API

| Name          | Type          | Default | Required | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `elementType` | `ElementType` | `h4`    | ‚úï        | Type of element                            |
| `isHeading`   | `bool`        | `true`  | ‚úï        | Whether the title is rendered as a heading |

On top of the API options, the components accept [additional attributes][readme-additional-attributes].
If you need more control over the styling of a component, you can use [style props][readme-style-props]
and [escape hatches][readme-escape-hatches].

### CardEyebrow

CardEyebrow is an optional subcomponent that accompanies the CardTitle.

```jsx
<CardEyebrow>Content options</CardEyebrow>
<CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
```

## CardFooter

Use CardFooter for actions or any other content at the bottom of the Card. When using Cards with CardFooter in a Grid,
the CardFooters will automatically line up.

```jsx
<CardFooter>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</CardFooter>
```

### Footer Alignment

The footer can be horizontally aligned to the start, center, or end of the Card. To align the footer, use one of the
following `alignmentX` prop values:

- `left` (default)
- `center`
- `right`

### API

| Name         | Type                                          | Default | Required | Description                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `alignmentX` | [AlignmentX dictionary][dictionary-alignment] | `left`  | ‚úï        | Alignment of footer content |

On top of the API options, the components accept [additional attributes][readme-additional-attributes].
If you need more control over the styling of a component, you can use [style props][readme-style-props]
and [escape hatches][readme-escape-hatches].

## Card Grid

In a typical use case, you will display multiple Cards in a [Grid][grid].

```jsx
<Grid cols={{ mobile: 1, tablet: 2, desktop: 3 }}>
  <Card>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</Card>
  <Card>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</Card>
  <Card>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</Card>
</Grid>
```

Depending on your situation, you may want to use the list semantics. And it will work!

```jsx
<Grid cols={{ mobile: 1, tablet: 2, desktop: 3 }} elementType="ul">
  <Card elementType="li">{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</Card>
  <Card elementType="li">{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</Card>
  <Card elementType="li">{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</Card>
</Grid>
```

## Best Practices

### Making the Whole Card Clickable

To make the whole Card clickable, use the provided CardLink subcomponent. For best accessibility, you would typically
wrap your CardTitle text in the CardLink component:

```jsx
<CardTitle>
  <CardLink href="#">Card title</CardLink>
</CardTitle>
```

This establishes a [clickable overlay][hugo-giraudel-card] over the whole Card, making it easier for users to interact
with the Card.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Don't worry, any interactive elements inside the Card (like links or buttons) will still work as expected.

If you need the text content of your CardBody remains [selectable and copyable][heydon-pickering-card], you can use the `isSelectable` prop on CardBody component:

```jsx
<CardBody isSelectable>
  <CardTitle>
    <CardLink href="#">Card title</CardLink>
  </CardTitle>
<CardBody>
```

### API

| Name          | Type          | Default | Required | Description     |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------- |
| `elementType` | `ElementType` | `a`     | ‚úï        | Type of element |

On top of the API options, the components accept [additional attributes][readme-additional-attributes].
If you need more control over the styling of a component, you can use [style props][readme-style-props]
and [escape hatches][readme-escape-hatches].

### Linking the Media

In most cases, using just a single link in the CardTitle and
[making the whole card clickable](#making-the-whole-card-clickable) is the best approach in terms of accessibility.
The Card will have a single accessible link which will be announced by screen readers.

However, if you cannot use the CardLink subcomponent, and you still need to make the media clickable, you can wrap the
CardMedia image in a link:

```jsx
<CardMedia>
  <Link href="#" aria-hidden="true">
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="" />
  </Link>
</CardMedia>
```

üëâ Please note that the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute is used to hide the link from screen readers so the user is not
confused by too many links in the Card.

### The ‚ÄúRead More‚Äù Use Case

For article previews or similar use cases, you may want to display a limited amount of text content with a ‚ÄúRead More‚Äù
link. For optimum accessibility, you should only provide this in the form of a text node, not a button or a link:

```jsx
<CardBody>
  <CardTitle>
    <CardLink href="#">Card title</a>
  </CardTitle>
  <p>{/* ‚Ä¶ */}</p>
  {/* DON'T DO THIS */}
  <Link href="#" underlined="always">Read more</Link>
  {/* This is correct */}
  <div class="link-primary link-underlined">Read more</div>
</CardBody>
```

This way, the Card will only have a single accessible link which will be announced by screen readers.

## Full Example

When you put it all together:

```jsx
<Card isBoxed>
  <CardMedia>
    <img src="‚Ä¶" alt="" />
  </CardMedia>
  <CardLogo>
    <PartnerLogo>
      <img src="‚Ä¶" alt="Logo" />
    </PartnerLogo>
  </CardLogo>
  <CardBody>
    <CardEyebrow>Content options</CardEyebrow>
    <CardTitle>
      <CardLink href="#">Card Title</CardLink>
    </CardTitle>
    <p>Card content</p>
  </CardBody>
  <CardFooter>
    <ButtonLink>Primary</ButtonLink>
    <ButtonLink>Secondary</ButtonLink>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```
