> React implementation of Spirit Design System components.

## Install

Expecting you have `react` and `react-dom` installed in your app, run:

```shell
yarn add @lmc-eu/spirit-web @lmc-eu/spirit-web-react
```

or

```shell
npm install --save @lmc-eu/spirit-web @lmc-eu/spirit-web-react
```

## Usage

Link Spirit CSS (see [`spirit-web` docs][web-docs] for more options):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-web/css/foundation.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-web/css/components.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-web/css/helpers.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-web/css/utilities.min.css" />
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to load all CSS files above and in the same order.

Import React components in your app:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@lmc-eu/spirit-web-react/components/Button';
```

### Prefixing CSS Classes in Components

To prefix the component classes with your own namespace, you can use the `ClassNamePrefixProvider` context to provide a prefix to all components in your app.

Check [`spirit-web` docs][web-pkg-prefixes] to learn how to prefix CSS class names.

```jsx
import { ClassNamePrefixProvider } from '@lmc-eu/spirit-web-react/context/ClassNamePrefixContext';

<ClassNamePrefixProvider value="jobs">
  <Button>Button</Button>
</ClassNamePrefixProvider>;
```

## Additional Attributes

All components accept additional attributes that are passed down to the root element of the component.
This is useful for adding custom event handlers, accessibility attributes, or other attributes that
are not supported by the component API.

‚ÑπÔ∏è To pass down event handlers to the native form elements in our form components,
you can use the `inputProps` prop.

Supported attributes are:

- `on*` (for example `onClick`)
- `data-*`
- `aria-*`
- `id`

If the component sets a value for any of these attributes, the value passed in will be overwritten.

Most components also accept native HTML attributes based on the component's element type.

## Styling

Spirit components are designed to be consistent across all Alma Career applications. They include built-in styling that has been
considered carefully, and extensively tested. In general, customizing Spirit design is discouraged, but most components
do offer control over layout and other aspects. In addition, you can use Spirit defined design tokens to ensure your
application conforms to design requirements, and is adaptive across platform scales and color schemes.

### Style Props

All Spirit components accept a set of props that can be used to control their outer spacing. The props are:

- `margin`
- `marginTop`
- `marginRight`
- `marginBottom`
- `marginLeft`
- `marginX`
- `marginY`

These props accept a spacing token (for example `space-100`), `auto` or an object with breakpoint keys and spacing token
values or `auto`. We use these props to set global CSS utility classes on the root element of the component.

Examples:

```jsx
<Alert marginBottom="space-100" />
<Button marginX={{ mobile: 'space-100', tablet: 'space-200' }} />
```

If you need even more control over the component styling, use [escape hatches](#escape-hatches).

### Escape Hatches

While we encourage teams to use Spirit design as it is, we do realize that sometimes product specific customizations
may be needed. In these cases, we encourage you or your designers to **talk to us**. We may be able to suggest
an alternative implementation strategy, or perhaps your design can help propose future Spirit additions.

While the traditional className and style props are not supported in Spirit Web React components, there are two escape
hatches that you can **use at your own risk**. These are UNSAFE_className and UNSAFE_style. Use of these props should be
considered **a last resort**. They can be used to work around bugs or limitations in Spirit Web React, but should
not be used in the long term.

The reasoning behind this is that future updates to Spirit design may cause unintended breaking changes in products.
If the internal DOM structure or CSS properties of a Spirit Web React component change, this may lead to conflicts
with CSS overrides in products. For this reason, className and style are unsafe, and if you use them know that you
are doing so at your own risk.

Please consult additional styling with [web package documentation][web-pkg-rebrand].

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

- A [Controlled Component][react-controlled] is one that takes its current
  value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onChange.
  A parent component "controls" it by handling the callback and managing its own
  state and passing the new values as props to the controlled component.
  You could also call this a "dumb component".

- An [Uncontrolled Component][react-uncontrolled] is one that stores its own
  state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value
  when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

All components are by default provided as _controlled_ components so you must provide your own controlling or toggle functionality to make them work as you want.

For a better developer experience there is also an _uncontrolled_ variant of the component provided.
You can use the `Uncontrolled` variant for faster development.

## Deprecations

This package uses the deprecation warnings for props, functions and components that will be removed or replaced in the next major release.
Check your browser console to see if you are using any of the deprecated functionality.

![Deprecations in the Browser's console](https://github.com/lmc-eu/spirit-design-system/blob/main/static/deprecations-browser-console.png?raw=true)

üëâ [See the DEPRECATIONS file][all-deprecations] for the list of all deprecations.

### Warnings in Environments

#### Production

The `warning` utility which is used for deprecation warnings checks the `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable to determine if the warnings should be shown.
If the environment variable is set to the `production` the warnings will not be shown.

#### Testing

While running tests, you likely will see the deprecation warnings.
You can suppress the warnings by simply mocking the implementation of the `warning` utility or `console.warn` function.
But we strongly discourage you from doing so, as the deprecation warnings are there to help you to prepare for the next major release.

  <summary>Example for Jest:</summary>

```ts
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.spyOn(console, 'warn').mockImplementation(() => {});
});

afterEach(() => {
  console.warn.mockRestore();
});
```
