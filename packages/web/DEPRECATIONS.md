## Deprecations

### Collapse `data-spirit-is-disposable`

The `data-spirit-more` attribute was removed, please use `data-spirit-is-disposable` instead.

#### Migration Guide

- `<a data-spirit-more â€¦ />` â†’ `<a data-spirit-id-disposable â€¦ />`

### Flex

The direction values `row` and `column` were removed, please use `horizontal` and `vertical` instead.

### Migration Guide

- `<div class="Flex Flex--row" />` â†’ `<div class="Flex Flex--horizontal" />`
- `<div class="Flex Flex--column" />` â†’ `<div class="Flex Flex--vertical" />`

### Header

The `Header` component was removed, please use `UNSTABLE_Header` component instead.
