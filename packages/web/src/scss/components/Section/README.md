# Section

The `Section` component is a fundamental building block to group related content into
semantically meaningful areas, enhancing both the structure and readability of your pages.

```html
<section>Content</section>
```

## Styling

Use utility classes to style the section component.

```html
<section class="py-900 py-tablet-1000 bg-primary">Content</section>
```

We suggest these sizes for the section component.

```html
