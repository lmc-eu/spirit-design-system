## Install

🙋🏻‍♂️ **Hold on! Do you already use [`spirit-web`]?** Then you don't need to
install this package because `spirit-design-tokens` is installed automatically
as a dependency of [`spirit-web`].

If you want to use just `spirit-design-tokens` alone in your project, run:

```shell
yarn add @lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens
```

or

```shell
npm install --save @lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens
```

## Basic Usage

The recommended approach in Sass is to import all Spirit design tokens at once
via the [`@tokens` API](#tokens-api):

```scss
@use 'sass:map';
@use 'node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss/@tokens' as tokens;

.MyComponentThatMightGoToSpiritInFuture {
  font-family: map.get(tokens.$body-medium-text-regular, font-family);
  color: tokens.$text-primary-default;
}
```

This makes it easier to [migrate your code to Spirit][migrate-to-spirit] in the
future.

<details>
<summary>Optional: import by categories</summary>

You can also import individual design token files by categories, e.g.:

```scss
@use 'sass:map';
@use 'node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss/colors';
@use 'node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss/typography';

.MyComponent {
  font-family: map.get(typography.$body-medium-text-regular, font-family);
  color: colors.$text-primary-default;
}
```

This approach is a bit more descriptive and thus provides slightly better
developer experience. You may find it more convenient in situations you
**don't** suppose your code will make its way to Spirit as this approach is
incompatible with `@tokens` API that makes rebranding possible.

</details>

### In JavaScript

Additionally the design tokens are also provided as a JavaScript object.

```js
import * as SpiritDesignTokens from '@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens';

const desktopBreakpoint = SpiritDesignTokens.breakpoints.desktop;
```

The structure is the same as in the SASS.

## `@tokens` API

`@tokens` API enables quick and easy rebranding of Spirit Sass styles by
[replacing the path](#b-via-load-path) to design tokens. You need to be familiar
with it if you are building your custom design system based on Spirit or you are
going to contribute to Spirit.

### Accessing `@tokens`

#### a) via full path

Access Spirit design tokens via the `@tokens` API without having to configure
load path, just like shown in the [basic example](#basic-usage). This is a good
choice for starting off quickly. However, it **doesn't enable rebranding**.

#### b) via load path

To get ready for rebranding, access Spirit design tokens via the `@tokens` API
while keeping them open to be replaced by another set of design tokens:

```scss
@use 'sass:map';
@use '@tokens' as tokens;

.MyComponentThatIsReadyForSpirit {
  font-family: map.get(tokens.$body-medium-text-regular, font-family);
  color: tokens.$text-primary-default;
}
```

##### Configuring Load Path

Because the `@tokens` file doesn't exist locally, tell Sass where it should
look for unreachable files. This is also a required step if you are importing
Spirit components from their Sass source.

```shell
sass --load-path=node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss my-styles.scss
```

<details>
<summary>Or with Webpack and <code>sass-loader</code>:</summary>

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

// …
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.scss$/,
      use: [
        'style-loader',
        'css-loader',
        {
          loader: 'sass-loader',
          options: {
            sassOptions: {
              includePaths: [
                path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules'),
                path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss'),
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
// …
```

</details>

### Exposing Your Custom Design Tokens

In Spirit, the [`@tokens.scss`] file simply @forwards all design tokens exposed
by [`index.scss`] which in turn @forwards all design token categories. To make
your design tokens compatible with Spirit, just create a `@tokens.scss` file and
@forward all your design tokens through it, e.g.:

```scss
// @tokens.scss

@forward 'borders';
@forward 'colors';
@forward 'gradients';
@forward 'measures';
@forward 'other';
@forward 'radii';
@forward 'shadows';
@forward 'typography';
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>
Why do I need to rename <code>@tokens</code> to <code>tokens</code> when @using?
</summary>

Because @using the `@tokens` module without renaming would produce an error:

```log
Error: Invalid Sass identifier "@tokens"
  ╷
1 │ @use '@tokens';
  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is there the <code>@</code> prefix?</summary>

We prefix the `@tokens.scss` file with `@` to differentiate it from other Sass
files in the directory.

In order for developers to know the file behaves differently than usual Sass
partials, a `@` prefix is added to mark this behavior both in filesystem and
inside Sass files. As a result, it's clear why e.g. `@use 'tools'` refers to
a local file and `@use '@tokens'` does not. However, **it's only a naming
convention,** there is no special tooling or configuration for Sass partials
starting with `@`.

Imported module **needs to be renamed to be compatible with SCSS** syntax
when it's used later on. That's why `@use '@tokens' as tokens`.

Look at the following snippets and compare which one offers better
comprehensibility.

Without `@` prefix:

```scss
// _Button.scss

@use 'tools'; // Calls './_tools.scss'. You don't have to explain this to me.
@use 'tokens'; // Wait, this file doesn't exist… What's going on here? Is it
// an error?
```

With `@` prefix:

```scss
// _Button.scss

@use 'tools'; // Calls './_tools.scss'.
@use '@tokens' as tokens; // OK, './_@tokens.scss' is not here, but the at-sign
// prefix suggests a special behavior. Maybe I'll learn more in the docs?
```

<summary>How do I derive design tokens for my own design system?</summary>

**Creating a custom design system derived from Spirit? Great to hear that! 🎉**

While it's perfectly OK to develop custom components that may not find their way
back to Spirit, your design tokens need to **include all Spirit design tokens**
anyway, so all Spirit components you are going to reuse work correctly with your
brand.

Simply put, if you are going to build a design system based on Spirit:

1. copy and paste all design tokens from here,
2. alter their values to fit your needs,
3. feel free to add anything necessary on top of that,
4. use your design tokens in your code (and compile Spirit with them).

To make your Sass design tokens compatible with Spirit, don't forget to expose
them via your custom [`@tokens` API](#tokens-api).
