## Available Design Tokens

Tokens are split into two categories: Global and Themes. Global tokens are
shared across all themes, while the theme tokens are specific to a particular theme.

They are managed in our [Figma][spirit-figma] and exported to our [Supernova workspace][spirit-supernova].

All content in `src` is generated by Supernova and should not be edited manually.

The `scss` directory contains `@global.scss` and `@themes.scss` files linking all available tokens.

### Global Tokens

The category consists of these groups:

- üñº Borders
- üñåÔ∏è Gradients
- ‚öôÔ∏è Other
- üé± Radii
- üèñÔ∏è Shadows
- üìèÔ∏è Spacing
- üî° Typography

These tokens are shared globally and independently on themes.

### Theme Tokens

You can find the list of the themes in the `src/themes` directory. Each theme has
its own directory with the same set of design tokens, but with different values.

Each theme consists of the same set of tokens, but with different values.

The category currently consists only of this group:

- üé® Colors

We currently support two themes:

- Light
- Light Inverted

Where the former is the default and both of them can be used on the same page.

## Install

üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Hold on! Do you already use [`spirit-web`][web-docs]?** Then you don't need to
install this package because `spirit-design-tokens` is installed automatically
as a dependency of `spirit-web`.

If you want to use just `spirit-design-tokens` alone in your project, run:

```shell
yarn add @lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens
```

or

```shell
npm install --save @lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens
```

## Basic Usage

SCSS is the primary language for styling Spirit components.

The best way to use the design tokens is to load their path in SASS:

```shell
sass --load-path=node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss my-styles.scss
```

Or integrate them into your build system:

<summary>Webpack example with <code>sass-loader</code>:</summary>

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

// ‚Ä¶
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.scss$/,
      use: [
        'style-loader',
        'css-loader',
        {
          loader: 'sass-loader',
          options: {
            sassOptions: {
              includePaths: [
                path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules'),
                path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss'),
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
// ‚Ä¶
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Vite example:</summary>

```javascript
// vite.config.js

// ‚Ä¶
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  css: {
    preprocessorOptions: {
      scss: {
        includePaths: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss')],
      },
    },
  },
});
// ‚Ä¶
```

</details>

This way the [`spirit-web`][web-docs] package or your own components can simply reach token values like this:

```scss
@use 'sass:map';
@use '@global' as global-tokens;

.MyComponentThatMightGoToSpiritInFuture {
  font-family: map.get(global-tokens.$body-1-regular, font-family);
  margin-bottom: global-tokens.$space-300;
}
```

For your components you can also load the token files directly:

```scss
@use 'node_modules/@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens/scss/@global' as global-tokens;
```

As mentioned, all themes contain the same set of tokens, so to use them you need to either
choose which theme you want to use and load it directly or use the `@themes` file to
generate CSS variables and use them in your components. The [`spirit-web`][web-docs] package does
this for you.

### In JavaScript

Additionally the design tokens are also provided as a JavaScript object.

```js
import * as SpiritDesignTokens from '@lmc-eu/spirit-design-tokens';

const desktopBreakpoint = SpiritDesignTokens.breakpoints.desktop;
```

The structure is the same as in the SASS.

## Rebranding Spirit

The system is designed to be easily rebranded. To do so, you need to provide
your own design tokens and use `@global` and `@themes` files. Then forward your tokens
to these files and set the correct load path for your project.

Your tokens should contain the same structure as the Spirit tokens. The simplest
way to do this is to have the same structure in your Figma file and export it
using Supernova. If that's not possible, you can copy our tokens and adjust their values
to your needs. You can also add new tokens required by your design system.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>
Why do I need to rename <code>@global</code> to <code>global-tokens</code> when @using?
</summary>

Because @using the `@global` module without renaming would produce an error:

```log
Error: Invalid Sass identifier "@global"
  ‚ï∑
1 ‚îÇ @use '@global';
  ‚îÇ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is there the <code>@</code> prefix?</summary>

We prefix the `@global.scss` file with `@` to differentiate it from other Sass
files in the directory.

In order for developers to know the file behaves differently than usual Sass
partials, a `@` prefix is added to mark this behavior both in filesystem and
inside Sass files. As a result, it's clear why e.g. `@use 'tools'` refers to
a local file and `@use '@global'` does not. However, **it's only a naming
convention,** there is no special tooling or configuration for Sass partials
starting with `@`.

Imported module **needs to be renamed to be compatible with SCSS** syntax
when it's used later on. That's why `@use '@global' as global-tokens`.

Look at the following snippets and compare which one offers better
comprehensibility.

Without `@` prefix:

```scss
// _Button.scss

@use 'tools'; // Calls './_tools.scss'. You don't have to explain this to me.
@use 'global'; // Wait, this file doesn't exist‚Ä¶ What's going on here? Is it
// an error?
```

With `@` prefix:

```scss
// _Button.scss

@use 'tools'; // Calls './_tools.scss'.
@use '@global' as global-tokens; // OK, './_@global.scss' is not here, but the at-sign
// prefix suggests a special behavior. Maybe I'll learn more in the docs?
```

<summary>How do I derive design tokens for my own design system?</summary>

**Creating a custom design system derived from Spirit? Great to hear that! üéâ**

While it's perfectly OK to develop custom components that may not find their way
back to Spirit, your design tokens need to **include all Spirit design tokens**
anyway, so all Spirit components you are going to reuse work correctly with your
brand.

Simply put, if you are going to build a design system based on Spirit:

1. copy and paste all design tokens from here,
2. alter their values to fit your needs,
3. feel free to add anything necessary on top of that,
4. use your design tokens in your code (and compile Spirit with them).

To make your Sass design tokens compatible with Spirit, don't forget to expose
them via Sass load path.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need themes? And if so, how many?</summary>

You need at least one theme to define the default values for your design tokens.
If you want to support multiple themes, you can add more. The number of themes
is up to you and your design system requirements.

But remember, each theme should contain the same set of tokens, just with different
values. This way, you can switch between themes without changing your components.
