## General Usage

This project uses `makefile` for managing various chores, like dependency installation, testing, linting etc. Make sure you run `make` right after you clone the repository - it will set you up with everything needed to get started. Once you are done with that, have a look at what commands (targets) are available for you to run using `make` - `make install` etc.

## Decisions

The reasoning behind various [decisions][decisions] made for the Spirit Design System. A good historical record.

## Project Structure

This project is a monorepo managed by [Lerna][lerna-home]. This means that each folder inside the [packages/][packages] directory represents a package published to npm. The root directory also contains _package.json_ file but this is only used for local development purposes and does not represent something that is ever published to npm (you might notice that it only contains _devDependencies_ and no prod dependencies ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

## Development

See [Developer Handbook][developer-handbook] for more information about development.

## Commit Conventions

All commits you make SHOULD adhere to our commit guidelines. We use [conventional commits][conventional-commits] strategy with a slight modification of our own - [@lmc-eu/commitlint-config][commitlint-config]. This is later used during the release phase to determine how to bump the packages' version numbers based on commit history. üöÄ

### Commit Message Format

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages MUST be formatted.
This format leads to **easier-to-read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```txt
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and MUST conform to the [Commit Message Header](#commit-header) format.

The `body` is optional but recommended for all commits except for those of type "Docs".
When the body is present it MUST be at least 20 characters long and MUST conform to the [Commit Message Body](#commit-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-footer) format describes what the footer is used for and the structure it MUST have.

#### Commit Message Header

```txt
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ             ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ             ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ Summary in present tense. Sentence case. No period at the end.
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ Commit Scope: analytics|design-tokens|form-validations|icons|web|web-react|web-twig|exporter-js|
  |                          exporter-scss|exporter-tokens|exporter-assets|ci|repo
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ Commit Type: Feat|Fix|Perf|Revert|Docs|Style|Refactor|Test|Chore|Deps
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

##### Type

MUST be one of the following:

<!-- @todo https://github.com/lmc-eu/code-quality-tools/issues/192 -->
<!-- textlint-disable @lmc-eu/lmc/terminology -->

- **Chore**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (e.g: CircleCI, Sauce Labs) or changes that affect the build system
- **Deps**: Changes to dependencies
- **Docs**: Documentation only changes
- **Feat**: A new feature
- **Fix**: A bug fix
- **Perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **Refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **Revert**: Reverting code changes
- **Test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **Style**: Changes to code style or styling of components and pages
<!-- textlint-enable -->

##### Scope

The scope SHOULD be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

The following is the list of supported scopes:

- Apps:
  - `demo`
- Exporters:
  - `exporter-js`
  - `exporter-scss`
  - `exporter-tokens`
  - `exporter-assets`
- Packages:
  - `analytics`
  - `codemods`
  - `design-tokens`
  - `form-validations`
  - `icons`
  - `web`
  - `web-react`
  - `web-twig`
- Repository-wide:
  - `ci`: used for changes that affect the Continuous Integration process and builds
  - `repo`: used for repository-wide changes
  - none/empty string: useful for `Test` and `Refactor` changes that are done across all packages (for example `Test: Add missing unit tests`) and for docs changes that are not related to a specific package (for example `Docs: Fix typo in the tutorial`).

##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- use the sentence case (capitalize the first letter of the sentence)
- no dot (.) at the end

#### Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message SHOULD explain _why_ you are making the change.
You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior to illustrate the impact of the change.

#### Commit Message Footer

The footer can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations and is also the place to reference GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to.

For example:

```txt
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

The breaking change section SHOULD start with the phrase "BREAKING CHANGE: " followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

### Revert Commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it SHOULD begin with `Revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body SHOULD contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of why the commit message is being reverted.

### Before Commit

Test your code before committing with `% yarn test` or `% yarn packages:test`. It will run type linting, code listing, testing, and code formatting.

## Code Style

This project uses Prettier for code formatting. You can run `make format` to format all your code before you submit your code for review.

## Documenting the Components

1. All components MUST be documented in a `README` file in the root of the component, for example `packages/web-react/Accordion/README.md`.
2. The documentation MUST be written in Markdown.
3. The documentation MUST contain at least a basic example usage of the component.
4. For complex components or components with subcomponents, the documentation SHOULD contain examples of individual building blocks as well as an example composition.
5. Component and subcomponent props MUST be documented in a table.
   1. The table MUST be placed in a section introduced by a headline called `API`.
   2. The table MUST contain the following columns:
      - `Name` ‚Äî the name of the prop, for example `title`
      - `Type` ‚Äî the type of the prop, for example `string`, `number`, `bool`, `[horizontal | vertical]`, an existing [dictionary][dictionary], etc.
      - `Default` ‚Äî the default value of the prop, for example `null` or `‚Äî` (em-dash) if there is no default value
      - `Required` ‚Äî if the prop is required `‚úì` or not `‚úï`
      - `Description` ‚Äî the description of the prop, for example `Title of the accordion`
   3. The props MUST be sorted alphabetically by their name.

## Testing

Each package contains a script called `test`.
Using this you can test the entire package and verify that all parts of the package are in good shape and all rules are met.

The testing script includes:

- linting using [ESLint][eslint]
- checking format using the [Prettier][prettier]
- checking types using the [TypeScript][typescript] compiler
- running unit test using the [Jest][jest]

### Unit Testing

You can run unit testing via `test:unit` scripts.
For all available scripts see the package's `package.json` file.

### Manual Testing

For a better testing experience, we are using deploy previews on Netlify.
If your modification affects the publishable code and when you create a PR, every push then will be deployed to Netlify.
Netlify will create a deploy preview and you can test your changes there.
Netlify will also attach a link to the deploy preview to your PR so you can easily access it.

#### Readable Netlify Links

For a better UI experience when searching for the deploy preview link, you can use this [Gist with userContent.css][netlify-preview-gist].

### Visual Regression Testing

**Prerequisites:** [Docker][docker] üê≥

You can run visual regression testing via `Makefile` in the project root.
All commands will execute a Docker command that starts [Playwright][playwright] in a containerized environment.

- Use `make test-e2e` to run the tests.
- Use `make test-e2e-update` to update the snapshots.
- Use `make test-e2e-report` to generate and serve a report of visual regression testing. Find a report URL in the terminal output.

üëâ Visual snapshots are generated based on the platform, so we need to use the same platform locally and on CI (GitHub Actions).

‚ö†Ô∏è The version number of the [Playwright][playwright] dependency must be the same in `package.json` file and in the `./bin/make/e2e.sh` to ensure that no additional [Playwright][playwright] dependencies will need to install (browsers are backed in the Docker image). See https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.

We run visual regression testing locally against our demo apps. Web and Web React packages are served using Vite.
Web Twig package is served using the Symfony app.

We have two test suites and you can find them in the `./tests/e2e` directory:

- `demo-homepages` - tests the homepages of our demo apps.
  - This test is used to verify that the demo apps are working properly and their homepages are not broken.
- `demo-components-compare` - tests components' pages of our demo apps'.
  - This test gets the list of components from the file system for each package and then it goes through each component and compares its page in all demo apps.
  - Only one screenshot is taken for each component. If you run the update command, only the last screenshot will be saved.

üëâ To save time and repository size, we test only in the Chromium browser and only on the desktop viewport.

#### On CI Pipeline

In CI we use Netlify to test against.

To enable visual regression testing on CI, you need to add label `run-visual-tests` to your PR.
Then the tests will be run against the Netlify deployment on every change pushed.

When the tests fail, there will be a comment in the PR with a link to the report and a message about the failure will be raised in the Slack channel `#spirit-design-system-notifications_en`.
You can also find the report URL in the GitHub Actions run under the `Run actions/upload-artifact` section.
Look for `Artifact download URL: https://github.com/lmc-eu/spirit-design-system/actions/runs/<run-id>/artifacts/<artifact-id>`.

‚ö†Ô∏è We do not deploy the Web Twig package to any environment, so you can only test it locally.

### Developing and Testing GitHub Actions

It can be time-consuming and painful to test GitHub Actions.
First, you have to change the GitHub Actions file locally, push your local code into the GitHub repository, and wait for the result.

To solve this issue, you can use [act][act] command-line tool to test and write the GitHub actions locally.

For more, please read the article [How to Run GitHub Actions Locally with the act command-line tool][act-article].

## Publishing

This project uses GitHub Actions to publish the packages automatically to npm.
New packages are published after the new tag is pushed to the main branch.
PR can be merged only by the appropriate group of maintainers.

### Steps to Create a New Package Version

1. Merge all appropriate PRs you want to publish into the appropriate branch
   - branches:
     - `main` - for the latest stable version
2. Run the `make version` command to bump the version number in packages (a new version number is determined automatically based on commit history)
3. Check that the version number is correct and everything looks good
4. Push changes and tags to repository
   4a. Run manually `git push && git push --tags` to push the changes to the remote
   4b. or use `git push --follow-tags` to push the changes and tags at once (works only when tags are annotated).
5. Publishing is done automatically by GitHub Actions (uses `build` script and `make publish` command)
