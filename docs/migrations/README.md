# Migration Guides

In this directory, you can find migration guides for all packages in the Spirit Design System.

For each major version of each package, there is a separate migration guide that describes the changes
and steps needed to migrate to the new version. The migration guides are named `migration-vX.md`,
where `X` is the version number and are located in the respective package directory.

Please refer back to each guide or reach out to our team if you encounter any issues during migration.
