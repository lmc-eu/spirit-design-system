## General Changes

### Themes

Starting from version 3, the design system now supports multiple themes based on the
theme tokens.

See our [Themes decision][themes-decision] for more information and why we decided to implement this feature.

#### Introduction

The design system now supports multiple themes based on the theme tokens. As in
[Figma][spirit-figma-file] where the first theme column is the default, the first theme in the
`@themes` tokens map is the **default**.

We use CSS variables to apply colors to the components. The CSS variables of the default theme
are set on the `:root` element.

To switch themes, we also generate CSS classes that can be applied to any element.
Theme names are the key names of the `$themes` map in the `@themes` file in the _design-tokens_ package.

#### Component Changes

We did all the work and our components are now using CSS variables to
apply colors.

Also, all your components or any custom styles you have that previously used
color tokens should be updated to use CSS variables. See [Migrating Your Own Components](#migrating-your-own-components) for more information.

#### Inverted Variants

Using themes, we were able to remove the `inverted` design tokens and component variants, and also some `brand` tokens.

### Spacing Values

New spacing values were added to the design system, updating spacing design tokens and affecting all spacing props and utility classes.

#### Migration Guide

Use this table to update the spacing tokens in your project.

|       | **Old tokens** | **New tokens** |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 0     | space-0        | space-0        |
| 1 px  | space-100      | space-100      |
| 2 px  | space-200      | space-200      |
| 4 px  | space-300      | space-300      |
| 6 px  | â€”              | space-400      |
| 8 px  | space-400      | space-500      |
| 12 px | space-500      | space-600      |
| 16 px | space-600      | space-700      |
| 20 px | â€”              | space-800      |
| 24 px | space-700      | space-900      |
| 32 px | space-800      | space-1000     |
| 40 px | space-900      | space-1100     |
| 48 px | space-1000     | space-1200     |
| 56 px | â€”              | space-1300     |
| 64 px | space-1100     | space-1400     |
| 72 px | â€”              | space-1500     |
| 80 px | space-1200     | space-1600     |
| 96 px | â€”              | space-1700     |

If you are going to use fulltext search-and-replace in your project, we suggest you to
start from the largest values and work your way down to the smallest ones.
This way you will avoid replacing values you already replaced.

### Helpers: Inverted Link

The `link-inverted` helper was removed. Use themes to switch the link colors.

### Helpers: Typography and Headings

As the word `text` was omitted from the typography tokens, the typography helpers
were updated to reflect this change. Also, the `heading` helpers were updated to
support the emphasis.

#### Migration Guide

Remove the `text` infix from `body` typography helpers.

For example:

- `.typography-body-large-text-bold` â†’ `.typography-body-large-bold`
- `.typography-body-xsmall-text-regular` â†’ `.typography-body-xsmall-regular`

More font weights are now available for headings.
Rename `text` to `bold` in the `heading` helpers.

For example:

- `.typography-heading-xlarge-text` â†’ `.typography-heading-xlarge-bold`
- `.typography-heading-xsmall-text` â†’ `.typography-heading-xsmall-bold`

### Utilities: Removed and New Classes

Some utility classes were removed and new ones were added.

Removed utility classes:

- `.text-brand-primary`
- `.text-brand-secondary`
- `.bg-basic`
- `.bg-cover`
- `.bg-inverted`
- `.bg-brand-primary`
- `.bg-brand-secondary`

New utility classes:

- `.text-tertiary`
- `.bg-primary`
- `.bg-secondary`
- `.bg-tertiary`

### Migrating Your Own Components

First, you need to update your design tokens. You can either use Supernova to export
your design tokens in new structure, or you can manually update your tokens, or update
our tokens package if you are using it.

Here are the steps to migrate your own components to use the new design tokens and themes:

1. If you load `foundation`, `components`, `helpers`, and `utilities` separately, you need
   to `@forward 'themes'` before them in your main SCSS file. If you load the whole `scss` folder,
   you don't need to do anything.
2. Replace module load `@use '@tokens' as tokens;` in your components with `@use '@global-tokens' as global-tokens;`.
3. Rename all the tokens in your components to use the new structure.
   1. Replace module name in all variable usages: `tokens.*` â†’ `global-tokens.*`.
   2. Replace all spacing tokens with new values. See [Spacing Values](#spacing-values) for more information.
   3. Replace all radius tokens with new values. We added a new radius token in between, so you need to update all of them.
   4. Replace all typography tokens with new values. We removed the `text` infix from typography tokens and added emphasized headings.
   5. Switch all color tokens to use CSS variables. Use the `token-prefix` token to set the prefix. // TODO update this after implementing DS-1493
   6. If you used `$border-style` tokens, you need to replace them with direct values (`solid`, `dashed`, etc.).
   7. If you used the `$focus` token, you need to replace it with the `$focus-ring` token.
   8. If you used `$grid-gutter` tokens, you need to replace them with equivalent `$grid-spacing` tokens.
4. That's it! You should now have your components updated to use the new design tokens and themes. ðŸŽ‰

Here is a simple example of how to update your component styles:

Before:

```scss
@use '@tokens' as tokens;

$color: tokens.$text-primary;
$gap: tokens.$space-400;
```

After:

```scss
@use '@global-tokens' as global-tokens;

$color: var(--#{global-tokens.$token-prefix}color-text-primary);
$gap: global-tokens.$space-500;
```

2. Replace `Button` classes with `Toast__close` class at the close button.

   - `<button class="Button Button--square Button--inverted">` â†’ `<button class="ToastBar__close">`
