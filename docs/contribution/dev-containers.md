# Dev Containers (Experimental)

This project supports [Dev Containers][dev-containers] for a consistent, containerized development environment.

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Container Image](#container-image)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [SSH](#ssh)
- [Git](#git)
- [Running E2E Tests](#running-e2e-tests)
- [Using AI Tools](#using-ai-tools)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker][docker]
- IDE with Dev Container support:
  - **VS Code:** [Dev Containers][vsc-dev-containers] extension
  - **JetBrains IDEs:** [Remote Development][jetbrains-remote-development] plugin (bundled, but must be enabled)

## Container Image

- **Base image:** [`node:20-bookworm`][node-image] — [Debian 12 (Bookworm)][bookworm] with:
  - Node.js 20 LTS
  - OS dependencies required by Playwright
  - Git
  - Make
  - curl
  - etc.
- **Custom Dockerfile:** extends the base image with [Corepack][corepack], [Playwright][playwright] Chromium (+ OS dependencies), and Git safe-directory config pre-baked into the image
- **Dev Container features:** [GitHub CLI][github-cli] (`gh`)
- **Tools installed at build time (Dockerfile):**
  - [Corepack][corepack] (enables Yarn)
  - [Playwright][playwright] OS dependencies (E2E testing)
- **Tools installed upon container creation (`postCreateCommand`):**
  - [Yarn][yarn] project dependencies
  - [Playwright][playwright] Chromium browser

The container automatically forwards ports for:

- Vite web server (3456)
- Storybook (6006)
- Playwright UI (9323)

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in your IDE
2. Use the "Reopen in Container" option
3. Wait for the container to build and dependencies to install
4. Run `make help` to see available commands

## SSH

### VS Code

In VS Code, your local SSH agent is automatically forwarded to the container.
No additional configuration is required.

### JetBrains IDEs

As we consider forwarding SSH to be a security risk, we do not forward SSH
to the container by default. This may change in the future.

## Git

Your Git user name and email are automatically configured inside the container.
Futhermore, GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed inside the container and can be used
to authenticate with GitHub CLI inside the container.

### VS Code

Your local [SSH](#ssh) agent is automatically forwarded to the container, so
you can use Git commands without any additional configuration.

### JetBrains IDEs

Run `gh auth login` to authenticate with GitHub CLI inside the container.

## Running E2E Tests

Since Playwright is installed in the dev container, you can run end-to-end tests directly:

```bash
yarn test:e2e         # Run all E2E tests
yarn test:e2e:update  # Run all E2E tests and update snapshots
yarn test:e2e:ui      # Run with Playwright UI
```

## Using AI Tools

The Dev Container supports AI-powered coding assistants. You can use tools like [Cursor][cursor], [Claude Code][claude-code],
[Open Code][open-code], or any other AI coding tool that integrates with Dev Containers.

### Authentication

Each AI tool has its own authentication method. Refer to the tool's documentation for setup instructions:

- [Claude Code][claude-code]
- [Open Code][open-code]
- [Cursor][cursor]
