    /**
     * There are generic headings which can be repeated across sections.
     * For example "API", "Options", "Theming".
     * If we are describing a few subcomponents in the same document, that's the case.
     * In Header, there were two "Navigation" headings for example.
     *
     * It turns out that IDEs and Git hosts handle the duplicate headings the same way,
     *  that is, in case of conflict when generating HTML, they add a number suffix
     *  to their ID (at least PhpStorm and GH do it).
     *
     * Tt's more a question of linking the headings than the duplication itself.
     * The question is whether it's more comfortable and sustainable for us to link to headings like `#card-1`
     *  (and, for a human reading the document, "Card" is what we want to see), or to be
     *  more specific and future proof in cases like `#cardbody-api` instead of #api-4
